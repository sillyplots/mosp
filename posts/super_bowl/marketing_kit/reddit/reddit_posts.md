**Title:** I calculated the 'Coffee Gravity' of every NFL stadium to predict Super Bowl LX. See how the Dunkin' loving Pats stack up against the Starbucks obsessed Seahawks.

**Body:**
I built an "interference-adjusted exponential decay model" to measure if teams perform better near their preferred coffee chain.

**The Data:**

**The Findings:**
*   **H1 (Patriots):** The Pats Run on Dunkin'. The New England Patriots offense performs markedly better in environments with high Dunkin' Gravity, and they struggle majorly in Starbucks zones. Their Rush EPA/play drops from +0.053 in Dunkin zones to -0.239 in Starbucks zones.
*   **H2 (Seahawks):** The Legion of Brew. The Seattle Seahawks defense forces 80% more turnovers per game in Starbucks heavy zones, and they hold opposing offenses to a 61.6 passer rating in those zones.
*   **The Sam Darnold Paradox:** Unlike his defense, Darnold CRUMBLES in Starbucks zones (75.4 Rating vs 124.4 in Dunkin zones). Still seeing ghosts from his time in New York?

**The Forecast:**
Based on Levi's Stadium's gravity (-5.8, a Starbucks Stronghold), here is the official forecast:

**Title:** The "Home Brew Advantage": Net Gravitational Pull of Starbucks vs Dunkin Donuts for every NFL Stadium [OC]

**Image to Upload:** `chart_for_dataisbeautiful.jpeg`

**First Comment:**
**Tools:** Python, Google Places API, Haversine Formula.
**Methodology:** Modeled the "Gravitational Pull" of coffee chains using an exponential decay function ($e^{-0.5d}$) based on distance $d$ from the stadium, with an interference term for contrasting chains.
