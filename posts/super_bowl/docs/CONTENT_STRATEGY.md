# Home Brew Advantage: The "Release" Strategy

## The Core Concept
The joke relies on the tension between **Hyper-Academic Rigor** (the blog/PDF) and **Hyper-Commercial Sports Media** (the broadcast graphic). We will play these two tones against each other across different platforms.

## Asset Inventory

### 1. The "Academic" Assets (For Blog & PDF)
*   **The Paper:** `robust_coffee_metrics.pdf` (The foundation of the joke. Written in LaTeX. Looks indistinguishable from a serious econometrics paper.)
*   **The Visualization:** `coffee_gravity_ranking_publication.jpeg` (Clean, Tufte-style scatter plot. "Data is Beautiful" aesthetic.)
*   **The Map:** `coffee_force_field_map_all.html` (Interactive rigor.)

### 2. The "Broadcast" Asset (For Social Media)
*   **The Social Card:** `broadcast_graphics/final_social_graphic_v6.png`
    *   *Why this works:* It translates the complex "Net Gravity" math into the language of football fans: "**Offense Runs on Dunkin**" vs "**Legion of Brew**". It looks like an expensive ESPN/Fox Sports promo graphic, complete with a holographic Starbucks projection.

## Channel-by-Channel Strategy

### 1. The Blog Post (The Hub)
**Tone:** Proper Scientific Journal.
**Content:** Deep dive into the methodology, LaTeX formulas, interactive maps.
**The Twist:** At the very end, after all the dry analysis, we drop the **Social Card** as the "Official Forecast," bridging the gap between the math and the meme.

### 2. Reddit (The Engine)
**r/nfl (Tuesday Morning - ~8:30 AM EST):**
*   **Title:** "I calculated the 'Coffee Gravity' of every NFL stadium to predict Super Bowl LX. See how the Dunkin' loving Pats stack up against the Starbucks obsessed Seahawks."
*   **Body:** Start with the "Scientific" findings (Table 1 & 2 from the blog). Explain the model.
*   **The Kicker:** "Based on Levi's Stadium's gravity (-5.8), here is the official forecast:" -> **Embed Social Card**.

**r/dataisbeautiful:**
*   **Post:** The clean scatter plot (`coffee_gravity_ranking_publication.jpeg`).
*   **Comment:** Link to the blog and the "Broadcast Forecast" in the comments.

### 3. Twitter / X (The Narrative Thread)
**Goal:** Hook them with the visual, keep them for the bit.
*   **Tweet 1:** "I built an interference-adjusted geospatial gravity model to see how the relative density of Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks locations will affect Super Bowl LX. 🧵"
*   **Tweet 2:** "H1: Pats Run on Dunkin'. Their Rush EPA drops from +0.05 to -0.24 when moving from Dunkin to Starbucks zones."
*   **Tweet 3:** "H2: Legion of Brew. Seahawks Takeaways increase by 80% in Starbucks heavy zones."
*   **Tweet 4:** "The Model's Prediction for Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium:" -> **Embed Social Card (`final_social_graphic_v6.png`)**.
*   **Tweet 5:** "Full methodology and PDF download: [Link]"

### 4. Instagram / TikTok (The Scroll-Stopper)
**Format:** Carousel.
*   **Slide 1:** The **Social Card**. It's high contrast, has big logos, and a clear score prediction. This is the hook.
*   **Slide 2:** The "Force Field Map" (Video/Gif of the map).
*   **Slide 3:** The Scatter Plot.
*   **Caption:** "Levi's Stadium is a Starbucks Fortress (+5.8 Gravity). Sorry Drake Maye. The numbers don't lie. ☕️🏈"
