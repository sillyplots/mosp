  <strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
  A new study identifies a "Home Brew Advantage" in the NFL, where the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks perform significantly better in environments dominated by their region's preferred coffee chain. The research suggests the Patriots' offense runs on Dunkin', while the Seahawks' defense thrives in Starbucks-rich environments. With Super Bowl LX being played in deep Starbucks territory, we investigate whether this environmental factor could be the key to victory.

In the post-Moneyball era no sport is safe from the overeager application of advanced analytics, and the NFL is no exception. Having fully embraced "Next Gen Stats," there's not a game that goes by where you don't hear some analyst citing an absurdly-specific-to-the-point-of-being-meaningless stat like "completion rate over expected when trailing by one score or less in the fourth quarter against the blitz" or pointing to "post game win expectancy" to explain away a loss. In 2023 they even analyzed how Travis Kelce performed when Taylor Swift was and wasn't in attendance. 

At the Ministry of Silly Plots, our motto is to apply serious analysis to ridiculous subjects. Now that the NFL is doing the opposite, we have ourselves a golden opportunity.

This [working paper (pending peer review)](/posts/super_bowl/docs/robust_coffee_metrics.pdf) proposes a novel environmental variable not yet considered by the NFL's top analytics experts: the **"Regional Coffee Chain Gravitational Pull."** We hypothesize that the regional dominance of major coffee chains exerts a measurable influence on team performance, specifically for teams with strong cultural associations to those brands. The upcoming Super Bowl matchup between the Dunkin' loving New England Patriots and Starbucks obsessed Seattle Seahawks provides a perfect opportunity to test this.

## Methodology
To quantify the "net coffee gravity" of each stadium, we employ an **Interference-Adjusted Exponential Decay Model**. We calculate the gravitational pull of every Starbucks and Dunkin' location in the US within 10 miles of all 30 NFL stadiums, adjusting for distance and market interference.

This interactive map lets you visualize the raw gravitational pull of each coffee chain surrounding each NFL stadium. A good example is MetLife Stadium, which sits right on the border of a Dunkin' and Starbucks turf war. Its location in East Rutherford gives Dunkin' the slight edge due to the strong Dunkin' presence in New Jersey, but there's still a strong Starbucks gravitational pull from across the river in New York City.

Strangely enough, we see a perfect 50/50 split across the league in terms of which coffee chain has the gravitational advantage. The strongest gravity on either side belongs to the Seahawks' Lumen Field. Unsuprisingly, the Starbucks capital of the world doesn't have a single Dunkin' within a 10 mile radius (or even the entire state for that matter). On the Dunkin' side, we have the Ravens' M&T Bank Stadium in the top spot, with the Patriots' Gillette Stadium as a close second.

</div>

The real kicker, though, is that Super Bowl 60 will be played in Levi's Stadium, which has the second highest net coffee gravity of any stadium in the league...in favor of Starbucks. From a coffee perspective, this is a Seahawks home game. To see how this might affect the outcome, we compared how each team performed so far this season (Regular Season + Playoffs) in games played within and outside of their preferred coffee region. Given the extreme gravitational pull of each team's home stadium, we only looked at away games to control for home field advantage.

## Pats "Run on Dunkin"

The New England Patriots, it appears, literally run on Dunkin'. The Patriots' offense suffers a drastic drop in production when entering "Starbucks Zones." The data shows they score **7.3 fewer points per game** and gain **71 fewer total yards** compared to games played in Dunkin'-heavy territories. This "Withdrawal Effect" suggests that the Patriots' offensive engine requires a specific blend of sugar and cream found only in a styrofoam cup from New England's favorite chain.

## "Legion of Brew"

Conversely, the Seattle Seahawks defense appears to be fueled by the distinct roast of Starbucks. In high-Starbucks gravity environments, the Seahawks' defense is measurably more disruptive, forcing **80% more turnovers per game** (1.80 vs 1.00), and they hold opposing quarterbacks to a passer rating of just 61.6. A Venti Iced Vanilla Latte with oatmilk and a glorified McDonald's breakfast sandwich seems to heighten their reaction times and aggression.

## Super Bowl LX Forecast

Super Bowl LX will be held at **Levi's Stadium**, the **second most Starbucks-dominant stadium in the league**, theoretically giving a strong edge to the Seahawks. However, an unexpected finding emerged regarding Seahawks QB Sam Darnold. Unlike his defense, Darnold exhibits a strong **negative correlation** with Starbucks Gravity. His passer rating drops by a staggering **49 points** (124.4 to 75.4) in Starbucks zones, suggesting he may still be seeing ghosts from his time in Dunkin' territory with the New York Jets. Many analysts cite Darnold as the big question mark for this game, and our bean counters confirm he is likely the key factor in determing who hoists the Lombardi Trophy.

**Final Prediction:** The environmental factors heavily favor a **Seahawks Defensive Victory**. Our analysis suggests the Seahawks defense will dominate the Dunkin'-deprived Patriots offense, who will struggle to find their footing in the run game in particular, and force at least one turnover (with the odds strongly leaning towards two). However, Sam Darnold's lingering Dunkin' affinity introduces a critical variable that could keep the game close.

    title: "Do NFL offensive linemen pancake their opponents more often when the stadium is closer to an IHOP?",
    date: "Nov 24, 2025",
    summary: "An investigation into the correlation between syrup proximity and blocking aggression.",
    content: `
  < h2 > Executive Summary</h2 >
      <p>This analysis investigates the critical, yet often overlooked, correlation between an NFL offensive lineman's proximity to an International House of Pancakes (IHOP) and their run-blocking performance. Using PFF run-blocking grades and precise geospatial data, we tested the hypothesis that closer proximity to a Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity improves on-field aggression ("Closer is Better").</p>

      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Global Null:</strong> Across the general population of NFL linemen (n=40,248), there is no statistically significant relationship. The average lineman appears indifferent to the siren song of syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Movers" Signal:</strong> However, when we isolate the "Movers" cohort—players who have played significant games (>= 10) at multiple stadiums—a highly significant signal emerges (p=0.0002). For these seasoned travelers, driving time matters.</li>
        <li><strong>The Pancake Zone:</strong> We identified a critical threshold of <strong>6 minutes</strong> driving time. Players within this radius perform significantly better, likely due to the theoretical possibility of a halftime round-trip.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The "Pancake Zone" Theory</h2>
      <p>The average NFL halftime lasts 13 minutes. This is a non-negotiable constraint of the sport. If a stadium is located more than 6 minutes away from an IHOP, a round-trip during halftime is physically impossible, even assuming a "wolf-it-down" consumption time of 60 seconds.</p>
      <p>We define the <strong>"Pancake Zone"</strong> as any stadium with a driving time of <strong>< 6 minutes</strong> to the nearest IHOP. Our hypothesis is simple: the mere <em>possibility</em> of a halftime crepe fuels elite performance.</p>

      <h2>The Evidence: Top 3 Movers</h2>
      <p>We analyzed 226 "Movers" and identified the three players with the steepest, statistically significant (p < 0.01) negative slopes—meaning their performance improves most dramatically as driving time decreases.</p>

      <h3>1. Mitchell Schwartz: The King of Pancakes</h3>
      <p><strong>Slope:</strong> -0.0163 (p=0.0007)<br><strong>Pancake Zone Boost:</strong> +2.15 Grade Points</p>
      <p>Mitchell Schwartz is the poster child for this theory. His performance at Ford Field and AT&T Stadium (both deep within the Pancake Zone) was elite. As he moves further away from the griddle, his powers wane.</p>

      <h3>2. Alejandro Villanueva: The Syrup Soldier</h3>
      <p><strong>Slope:</strong> -0.0158 (p=0.0062)<br><strong>Pancake Zone Boost:</strong> +1.68 Grade Points</p>
      <p>Villanueva shows a similar, undeniable trend. His ability to protect the edge appears directly tied to his ability to visualize a short stack. Note the sharp decline as driving times exceed the critical 10-minute mark.</p>
      <img src="/images/pff_analysis/alejandro_villanueva_drivingtimeseconds.png" alt="Alejandro Villanueva Trend" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;">

      <h3>3. Andrew Whitworth: The Veteran Connoisseur</h3>
      <p><strong>Slope:</strong> -0.0116 (p=0.0043)<br><strong>Pancake Zone Boost:</strong> +0.91 Grade Points</p>
      <p>Even with a sample size of 229 games, Whitworth's data holds up. The consistency is remarkable. For a man who played into his 40s, the proximity to comfort food may have been the secret to his longevity.</p>
      <img src="/images/pff_analysis/andrew_whitworth_drivingtimeseconds.png" alt="Andrew Whitworth Trend" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;">

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>While correlation does not imply causation, the p-values here are hard to ignore. For a specific breed of elite NFL lineman, the "Pancake Zone" is real. It represents a psychological safety net—a knowledge that, should the game go south, a Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity is theoretically just a halftime drive away.</p>
      <p>Teams drafting offensive linemen should strongly consider relocating their stadiums to strip malls adjacent to major highways. The data demands it.</p>
